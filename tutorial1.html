                        <p>
                            If you haven't really downloaded a roblox game and don't know how to upload one, you've come to the right place! Well, we would be doing more than uploading the game, as uploading the animations and setting the game private so roblox mods won't catch us.</p>
                        <p>
                            Incase you haven't downloaded the file, make sure to do so before continuing the tutorial.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After downloading, you should be able to know where downloads are set, else simply click this icon to see the download is. Though it may depend on your browser.</p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s2.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            I would personally drag the downloaded file to the desktop as it's easier for me to access it.<br> ALRIGHT, so guessing it's there let's move to the next step! 
                        </p>
                        <h1><u>MAKE SURE TO DO IT ON AN ALT</u></h1>
                        <p>
                            Open your game (im guessing you have studio already installed, if not please install it and come back) and you should be on this window.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s3.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            I would like you to head towards the explorer (in the right), if it's not open by default, follow the image below.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s4.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            Great, now that you're on your explorer window follow the images as followed!
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s5.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s6.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            Now open every button inside and it should look like this.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s7.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>T
                            o upload the animation you should be seeing a blue box, right click it and you should get these options and click "save to roblox"
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s8.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s9.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s10.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s11.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            Great, now you got the animation ID you just copied and all you have to do now is PASTE it and you have your own condo animation (i blurred the last end of the id for privacy reasons) 
                            <br> Now head over to explorer and this section showed below and paste the id there.
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s12.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            For the next step you need "properties" opened, if you don't know what it is or doesn't have it open follow the image below!
                        </p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s13.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s14.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            TADA~ You're done! Well, not really >:)
                            <br> You got more buttons to go, but believe me it only takes around 5s to do everything when you know what you're doing. 
                        </p>
                        <p>After uploading animations, all you have to do is publish your game!</p>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s15.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <br>
                        <img src="images/tutorial1/s16.png" class="image fit" alt="">
                        <p>
                            Amazing, it's uploaded. Now before playing there's one more thing we should do and it's turning the game to r6. Why? Animations won't work in r15 that's why.
                        </p>

                            Wow you got your own condo now! congrats, but if you want to play with friends you got to add them to development on this specific game (google how to) but if you don't want to do that you'll have to resort to making it public which would only terminate the game thanks to roblox moderation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            ANDDDDD to play your condo follow these simple steps.
